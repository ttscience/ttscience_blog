# Introduction to Clinical Data Science at TTSI

This is a demonstration of how **R Markdown** can be used to generate reports and visualizations relevant to **clinical data science**. At **TTSI**, we specialize in study simulations, sample size estimation, and live anomaly detection. Markdown allows us to format reports that are dynamic and reproducible.

You can embed an R code chunk like this to perform basic data analysis, for example:
    

``` r
# Example using the built-in cars dataset
summary(cars)
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

# Simulate a simple linear model that could be relevant in clinical data analysis
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)        speed  
##     -17.579        3.932
```

# Including Visualizations

At TTSI, visualizations are essential for interpreting complex data from clinical trials. Below is a sample pie chart (Figure <a href="#fig:pie">1</a>) demonstrating a common method for displaying categorical data distributions, like treatment groups in a clinical study.


``` r
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
    c(150, 100, 50),
    c('Treatment A', 'Treatment B', 'Placebo'),
    col = c('#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e', '#2ca02c'),
    init.angle = -30, border = NA
)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/pie-1.png" alt="Distribution of Treatment Groups in a Study." width="672" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:pie"></span>Figure 1: Distribution of Treatment Groups in a Study.</p>
</div>

# Conclusion

This document showcases how **R Markdown** can be effectively utilized at **TTSI** for producing clinical reports, visualizations, and data analysis outputs that are dynamic and reproducible.
