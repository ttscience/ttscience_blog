We’re writing here as practitioners in clinical statistics, data science, and machine learning. Our team consists of Biostatisticians, Data Scientists, Bioinformaticians and Developers. We’re not marketers—we’re the ones in the trenches, working with data every day to solve real-world problems. We support researchers, scientists, and hospitals in medical and life sciences research projects by delivering relevant documentation, software, and statistical reports, utilizing programming languages such as R and Python.

“Data for good” is in our DNA. We’re passionate about doing meaningful work, which includes engaging in open-source projects. We don’t just crunch numbers; we aim to make a positive impact through our expertise. Our main goals include supporting investigators in the planning, execution, and finalization of clinical trials—covering tasks such as sample size calculations, study design, developing clinical trial protocols in compliance with EMA and FDA guidelines, creating Statistical Analysis Plans (SAPs), validating data, and generating statistical reports — as well as developing dedicated software, including applications such as to facilitate the analysis and validation of medical data.  

We believe in science and want innovative scientists to tackle the questions and challenges of today’s world. We want scientists to always be able to rely on data—because we all rely on them. Our partnership approach is rooted in the scientific method—we combine data, our clients’ expertise, and our competencies to achieve the best results. 

Our mission is to share knowledge with the broader community engaged in medical IT software development, clinical research, and the analysis of medical and biological data, as well as those just beginning their careers in these fields. Through our published content, we aim to showcase solutions for software development and provide guidance to researchers, particularly in the areas of statistics, machine learning, and the regulatory frameworks of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
